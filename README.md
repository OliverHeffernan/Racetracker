    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul>
      <li>To add a particpant to the race once the form has been filled out, click "Enter another runner" and the form will reload for the next participant to be entered.</li>
      <li>Once the last participant has been entered, you can close the form using the X button at the top right of the form.</li>
      <li>When entering the bib numbers, you can either choose the bib number for each participant, or click the choose random bib number. This will make sure that nobody has the same number. It is impossible to have more than one athlete with the same number.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Distribute the bib numbers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can view the entries along with all their details, including their bib numbers by clicking the left arrow in the top right corner of the screen. This will open a side panel.</li>
      <li>As the participants finish the race, their bib numbers will be entered into the system, so it is important that they have their bib number either written on their hand, or on a bib.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>The race is now all set up. When the race starts, click the "start race" button, and the timer will start.</h3>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>As each runner crosses the finish line, click the "Record Runner Time" button.</h3>

      <li>Enter their bib number into the entry field under the "Bib No." column, and the rest of their details will automatically be filled in.</li>
      <li>It is a good idea to have somebody else writing down the bib numbers as they finish, as it can be difficult to type in the bib numbers while lots of people are crossing the finish line.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Once all participants are finished, you can press the "stop race" button.</h3>
